## Bio

I'm an economist working at Mexico's Social Security Institute ([IMSS](https://datos.imss.gob.mx/)) where I've had the chance to work on one of Mexico's most pressing issues: reducing informality and making work more inclusive and secure.

I'm currently studying a M.S. in Applied Economics at [ITAM](itam.mx) and I'm interested in the intersection of economic development, data science and public policy.

Here you can check out my [CV](cv.qmd) and a [selection of work](research.qmd) I've done.

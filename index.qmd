## Bio

I'm an economist in training. I work at Mexico's Social Security Institute (IMSS) where I've had the chance to work on one of Mexico's most pressing issues: reducing informality and making work more inclusive and secure.

I'm looking forward to finishing my M.S. at Applied Economics at ITAM, to get a better sense of what can be done to improve labor relations in Mexico.

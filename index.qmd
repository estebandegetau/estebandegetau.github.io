# About Me

I am an economist working at the World Bankâ€™s Development Research Group (Macroeconomics and Growth) as Short-Term Consultant. I hold an M.S. in Applied Economics with high honors from [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/). Previously, I worked at the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), where I developed an interest in labor market transitions and social protection policy. My research draws on labor economics and applied econometrics, and I plan to begin doctoral studies in economics in 2026.
